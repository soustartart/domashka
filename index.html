<p id="white">Super Mario[a] (also known as Super Mario Bros.[b] and Mario[c]) is a platform game series created by Nintendo starring their mascot, Mario. It is the central series of the greater Mario franchise. At least one Super Mario game has been released for every major Nintendo video game console. There are more than 20 games in the series.</p>

<p> The Super Mario games are set primarily in the fictional <span class="a">Mushroom Kingdom</span>, typically with Mario as the player character. He is usually joined by his brother, Luigi, and often by other members of the Mario cast. As platform games, they involve the player character running and jumping across platforms and atop enemies in themed levels. The games have simple plots, typically with Mario and Luigi rescuing the kidnapped Princess Peach from the primary antagonist, Bowser. The first game in the series, Super Mario Bros., released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985, established the series' core gameplay concepts and elements. These include a multitude of power-ups and items that give the character special powers such as fireball-throwing and size-changing.[1]</p>
    
<p class="lightred2">  The <span class="lightred">Super Mario</span> series is part of the greater Mario franchise, which includes other video game genres and media such as film, television, printed media, and merchandise. More than 380 million copies of Super Mario games have been sold worldwide, making it the fifth-bestselling video game series, behind the larger Mario franchise, the puzzle series Tetris, the series Pokémon video games, and first-person shooter series<span class="lightred">Call Of Duty</span>.[2]</p>

<h3>Luigi (ルイージ Ruīji?, Luigi) is an Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom. He is Mario's younger and taller twin brother. Luigi is the deuteragonist of the Mario franchise and the main protagonist of Luigi's Mansion series and Mario's Time Machine. He is Mario's younger twin brother who first appeared as a palette swap of Mario in Mario Bros. for the Arcade (and later, for the NES). He wears green instead of red and is taller and slimmer than Mario. While Mario is everyone's favorite superstar, Luigi is not nearly as well known among the citizens of the Mushroom Kingdom. Countless times, especially in the Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi series, he is shown to be a rather clumsy coward. People in the Beanbean Kingdom never recognized him in Mario & Luigi: <span class="a">Superstar Saga and Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions,</span> simply referring to him as "greenie" or "the other guy"</h3></div>
